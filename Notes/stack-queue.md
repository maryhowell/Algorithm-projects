# Notes from Algo Meetup

#### what is the difference between stacks and queues?
-  In very simple terms, a stack is a collection of objects in which objects are accessed in LIFO (Last In First Out) fashion. (pancakes)
  * first thing processed is the newest
- Whereas a queue is a collection of objects in which objects are accessed in FIFO (First In First Out) sequence. (line of people)
  * first thing processed is the oldest
- bag data structure
  * not ordering based on insertion
  * don't care about time in and time out.

- priority queue (heap)
 * apps on a phone/ desktop
 * time it was opened and actively being used.
