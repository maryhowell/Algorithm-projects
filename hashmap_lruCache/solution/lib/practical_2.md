## Problem
This is a two part problem:
1. First, write a series of instructions on how to build out an LRU Cache (pretend
the person you're writing to has no idea how to build one. Don't forget to address
the reasoning behind using particular data structures).
2. Implement an LRU Cache from scratch with no outside references. **Don't look
at the code or instructions from your homework!**

## Solution

### Part 1
<!-- this is a BIG one that google asks about! -->
Write first part here:
1. Create LinkedList (has a prev and next node to denote where it is in the list)
  All items will be appended to the end of the list. When the item is called it gets put to the end of the
  list so the item at the beginning of the list will be deleted to make room for the newest item 
####  Least Recently Used

2.

### Part 2
```ruby
class LRUCache
  link = LinkedList.new
  hash = HashMap.new


end
```
